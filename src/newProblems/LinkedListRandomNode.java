/**
Given a singly linked list, return a random node's value from the linked list. Each node must have the same probability of being chosen.

Follow up:
What if the linked list is extremely large and its length is unknown to you? Could you solve this efficiently without using extra space?

Example:

// Init a singly linked list [1,2,3].
ListNode head = new ListNode(1);
head.next = new ListNode(2);
head.next.next = new ListNode(3);
Solution solution = new Solution(head);

// getRandom() should return either 1, 2, or 3 randomly. Each element should have equal probability of returning.
solution.getRandom();
 */
//TO_HURRY
public class LinkedListRandomNode 
{

    /** @param head The linked list's head.
        Note that the head is guaranteed to be not null, so it contains at least one node. */
    public LinkedListRandomNode(ListNode head) {
        
    }
    
    /** Returns a random node's value. */
    public int getRandom() {
        
    }
}

/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Solution obj = new Solution(head);
 * int param_1 = obj.getRandom();
