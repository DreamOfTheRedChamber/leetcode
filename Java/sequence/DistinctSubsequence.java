/*
Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of T in S.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

Example
Given S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit", return 3.

  * @return: Count the number of distinct subsequences
  */
 public int numDistinct( String S, String T )
 {
  // write your code here
  return 0;
 }
