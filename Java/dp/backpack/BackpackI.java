/*
Given n items with size Ai, an integer m denotes the size of a backpack. How full you can fill this backpack?

 Notice

You can not divide any item into small pieces.

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
If we have 4 items with size [2, 3, 5, 7], the backpack size is 11, we can select [2, 3, 5], so that the max size we can fill this backpack is 10. If the backpack size is 12. we can select [2, 3, 7] so that we can fulfill the backpack.

You function should return the max size we can fill in the given backpack.
