### 12/05/2019
* 说刷题会影响人的心态，不如说是品题，更为恰当一些
* 有时一道题自己会出神挺长时间，这是一个练习冥想的好机会
* 和他人比较是许多问题的源头，明确自己的目标，守住心中的亮光

### 12/06/2019
* For some corner cases, better add a todo item or test, otherwise easy to forget
* Write test first, then write code. In this way could think from the big picture in the beginning
* Don't belittle easy problems. The edge case is the trap here. 

### 12/07/2019
* Every problem not taking more than 1 hour, otherwise the progress could not be guaranteed and it is easy to get tired.
