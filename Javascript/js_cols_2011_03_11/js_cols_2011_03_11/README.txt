js_cols is a JavaScript collections library providing implementations of Lists, FIFO queues, LIFO Stacks, Priority Queues, sorted and unsorted Sets and Maps, Bags (Multi Sets) and Multi Maps.
The goal of the project is to add functionality to the JavaScript language, similar to that of java.util (for Java) and the C5 Library (for C#).
The Library stands alone and should be easy integratable in all kinds of JavaScript projects. 

For a quick start you can just include the js_cols_compiled.js file. This is a 64 kb file including the entire js_cols library.

see http://code.google.com/p/jscols/ or http://jscols.com  for more information.

The js_cols library was designed and written by Thomas Stjernegaard Jeppesen, 2010
